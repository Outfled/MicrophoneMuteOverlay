Custom DirectX 11 D3D11 Overlay for [OutfledMicrophoneMute](https://github.com/Outfled/OutfledMicrophoneMute) using MinHook & ImGUI

Majority of the hooking/ImGUI code is from [Universal-ImGui-D3D11-Hook](https://github.com/Sh0ckFR/Universal-ImGui-D3D11-Hook)

*Some game applications (such as Overwatch) will not load any unknown dll files that do not have a digital signature. To circumvent this, I use [SigThief](https://github.com/secretsquirrel/SigThief) to steal a valid signature from a signed Discord dll file. See [readme](sigthief/readme.md) for more information*
